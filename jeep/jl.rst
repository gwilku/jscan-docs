Choosing the right adapter
==========================

Jeep JL (and JT) are quite advanced in terms of electronic systems installed in the vehicle. Some of these systems don't operate on the standard CAN bus network, and to access them you will need either the OBD Link MX+ or vLinker MC+ adapter.

The affected modules are:

- HVAC (Heat, Ventilation, Air Conditioning)
- BSM (Blind Spot Module)
- some other radio features

Bypassing the Security Gateway
==============================

Chryslerâ€™s Secure Gateway Module came out in 2018. The SGW is a module whose function is simply to keep the communication networks secure. The SGW protects the vehicle networks from being exploited by creating a firewall between two portions of the network with the most vulnerability. This means, that to make any changes, you will need a SGW bypass - usually a cable. See our `SGW Bypass`_ page for details.



Changing TPMS thresholds
========================

1. `Connect`_ to your vehicle
2. Open Adaptation
3. Open TPMS settings
4. Set TPMS thresholds in the following:

	- Light Load Inflation Pressure Front / Rear Tire: Leave at 0.
	- Max Load Inflation Pressure Front / Rear Tire: This value is used as the **minimum** pressure. Change this to your liking.

5. Close the car, let it sit for a few minutes. If you see no change in behaviour, continue to the next step:
6. Reset the TPMS. Use **!Restart all ecus** option:

	- from the drop-down menu choose Tire Pressure Monitor - Power On Restart
	- tap GO
	- once procedure is complete, repeat step 5.


ESS - Engine Start/Stop System
==============================

.. warning:: ESS settings **will not work** on their own and require a small hardware change.

To successfully disable the ESS you will need to complete **both** changes below:

Software settings:
------------------

1. Connect to your vehicle in JScan
2. Go to Adaptation > Auto Stop/Start (ESS) Settings and see the following:

	.. image:: ../img/JL_ESS.jpg

	a) Auto Start/Stop On/Off - disable this setting to stop the ECU from monitoring the Hood Ajar switch.
	
	.. note:: This will also disable Remote Start feature.

	b) Auto Start/Stop Menu Present On/Off - disable this setting to remove the ESS-related menu entries on your instrument cluster (dashboard).
	
	.. note:: If you don't want to disable ESS but want to explore any issues with the system, enable this option - it will give you quite a good overview of the system status.

3. Disconnect JScan
4. Turn the vehicle OFF

Hardware mod:
-------------

Open the hood and follow the instructions below to disengage the Hood Ajar sensor:

	a) The sensors (two of them) are basically simple switches. Located just next to the grille on the left side of the vehicle (on your right, when you stand in front and look at the hood).

	b) You need to remove only one of the sensors, but leave it plugged in to the harness

	c) On the top side of the sensor, there are two tabs in the ring that mount the sensor to the metal bracket. Press both of them to release the sensor.

	d) Pull the sensor up

	e) Gently pry the plastic tab that holds the sensor together to disconnect the top part

	f) Pull the cable along with the lower part through the metal bracket opening

	g) Reassemble the sensor and secure it below & behind the bracket in an extended position (do not squeeze it - you want to simulate the hood open state)

Tire size - Manual transmission
===============================
When changing tire size in a JL with a **manual** transmission it is necessary to follow the procedure below to avoid DTC P08A6 error.

1. Restart the PCM (Power Control Module) by either disconnecting the battery (batteries) or using JScan *!Restart all ECUs* adaptation
2. Once reset, drive the Jeep so:
	a) Vehicle speed is 40-80mph, in 6th gear
	b) Accelerator pedal position is more than 0.392 volts
	c) Flywheel torque is >75 Nm
3. Drive like this for at least 20 seconds.
4. Once the module reads all the data it will re-enable the all gear sensor performance diagnostic.



LED lights / indicators warning
===============================

When original traditional lights / indicators are replaced with LEDs, even if you set the corresponding settings to let the ECU know that LEDs are present, it is possible to get a dashboard error about malfunctioning light / indicator.

If you are certain the lights / indicators work properly and want to remove the error from your dashboard:

1. Go to Adaptation
2. Tap search (a magnifying glass in a green circle)
3. Type "diagnostics"
4. Disable the corresponding "diagnostics present" setting.

This will tell the ECU not to monitor the state of the sepcified lamp or indicator.



Enabling auto high beam option on Jeep JL / JT
==============================================

.. note:: - this REQUIRES you have the forward facing module up center of the windshield, in the area of the inside rear view mirror. This contains the DASM. It's the radar and camera that handles ACC, Forward Collision Warning, etc.

This option may not work on early 2019 JL models - software update at the dealer may be required. 

If you do not have that black box up there, you cannot enable auto high beams.

Go to Adaptations and open group "Auto Headlamp & Auto High Beam"

* Auto High Beam -> Activated  it will activate this option
* Auto High Beam Module Location -> Select IRCM - this tells ecu where the module is installed
* Auto High Beam On Threshold -> 25 km/h - this is default on some cars, on others it is 0 and in booth cases it should work.
* Auto High Beam Off Threshold -> 20 km/h - this is default on some cars, on others it is 0 and in booth cases it should work.
* Auto High Beam CSM Present-> Activated Radio settings screen under "Lights", adds the menu selection so you can turn it on or off

=======================================================================

* Off Road Capable -> Activated
* Off Road Camera Present -> Activated
* Rear Camera Present -> Deactivated
* Reversible Washer Pump Enable -> Activated
* Connector A Pin 14 - Washer Motor Control Right -> Active
* Rear View Camera Gridlines On/Off - Deactivated
* Rear Camera Customer Settings Menu on Radio On/Off - Deactivated
