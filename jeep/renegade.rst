Quick info
==========

Renegade, Compass, and Cherokee are supported, but you need to know the following:

1. They are Fiats with a Jeep badge, and have a completely different software and different customisation options.
2. You need to perform PROXI alignment after making changes (research it online please), which:
3. requires vLinker MC+ (Cherokee) or vLinker MS (Renegade and Compass), as theese are the only reliable OBD adapters that can perform PROXI, and even then in certain cases a special blue OBD cable might be required.
4. If you acknowleddge the above, you can go to JScan settings > app & adapter settings > and enable 'show experimental vehicles'. 

And we highly encourage you to do it first, and explore the vehicle options in Demo mode (especially see PROXI and it's description) before investing in a license and adapter.

In addition, as with all other 2018+ vehicles from Stellantis, you will need a Security Gateway Bypass cable.

Introduction
=============

After Jeep has become part of FCA / Stellantis, three new models have been launched in cooperation with Fiat. Jeep Renegade, Compass, and Cherokee are technically  much closer to the Fiat rather than the Jeep and share the software with the Fiat family. Because of this, applying changes to them is far more complex and requires:

	- OBD Link MX+ adapter

	AND/OR

	- any compatible adapter
	- grey OBD adapter cable
	- blue OBD adapter cable

These cables allow the OBD adapter to access additional networks, which are used by the vehicles' modules. 

Because of the above, please launch the app in the Demo mode, choose your vehicle and check the PROXI Alignment section to see which cables are required for each alignment.

PROXI Alignment
===============

After you make the desired changes (adaptations), the vehicle configuration must be uploaded to all controlling modules. This is called PROXI alignment, and is done as follows:

* go to PROXI alignment adaptation
* execute all PROXI alignments for modules that *DO NOT* require a coloured cable
* don't worry when the information is not updated correctly immediately - this is normal
* unplug the adapter and plug it back in with the grey cable
* perform PROXI adaptations on modules that require the gray cable
* unplug the adapter and plug it back in with the blue cable
* perform PROXI adaptations on modules that require the blue cable
* disconnect
* cycle the ignition
* reconnect
* open PROXI alignment adaptation: all modules should be good to go

This procedure must be performed before driving the car, so you can make more than one adaptation before doing the PROXI alignment. In other words, there is no need to do the PROXI alignment after every single adaptation, but you must do it when you want the car to be fully operational again.
