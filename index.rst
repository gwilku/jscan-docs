.. title:: JScan documentation project.

As JScan is growing bigger and bigger, with more features and more suported vehicles, we decided to initiate this documentation project.
As time passes, we hope this evolves to become the main source of knowledge about adaptations, diagnostics and maintenance procedures enabled in the app.
