Driver Assistance System Module (DASM) calibration
==================================================

.. note:: Applies to RAM DT, Wrangler JL, Gladiator JT, Wrangler 4XE (and possibly some more models)

DASM Auto Alignment procedure is used to recalibrate the Driver Assistance System Module (DASM) after replacement, windshield change, tire diameter alteration, or when certain fault codes appear.
This prcedure runs the auto-  alignment process for the DASM, ensuring it is correctly calibrated for optimal performance.
Procedure has to complete booth steeps without interruption.
If the DASM is not properly aligned, it may lead to incorrect operation of driver assistance features, such as adaptive cruise control, lane-  keeping assist, and automatic emergency braking.

If you can't complete the procedure, you can manually adjust the DASM angle using the steps below.

Introduction
The Driver Assistance System Module (DASM) needs recalibration if it has been replaced, the windshield was changed, tire diameter was altered, or if certain fault codes appear. The main step is adjusting the module’s angle with the screw.

How to Adjust the Screw
-  Measure the angle
-  Place a digital inclinometer against the cooling ribs on the back of the DASM.
-  Record the vertical angle.
-  Adjust the screw
-  Use an E5 Torx tool on the adjustment head screw (marked “1” in the diagram).
-  Turn in small increments to move the module angle.
-  After each adjustment, remove the tool and recheck the angle with the inclinometer.
-  Target specification
-  The DASM must be set at -  1° ±0.2° from vertical (ideal: -  1° ±0.1°).
-  Repeat until correct
-  Measure → adjust screw → remeasure, until the angle is within specification.


Finalize calibration
-  Run procedure DASM Auto Alignment.
-  Follow on-  screen instructions to complete calibration.
