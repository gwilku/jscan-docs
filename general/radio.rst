Radio Region (work in progress)
===============================

Before converting the radio frequencies to EU:

1. Delete all saved radio stations
2. Disable HD mode (main screen) - IMPORTANT.

In JScan

1. Go to Radio User settings and change all units to active (metric).
2. Leave „US/Metric under radio setting on/off” as deactived.
3. Change "Radio Market" to Germany.
4. Reset the radio with „!Restart all ecus” > „All modules - power on restart”.
5. Turn the vehicle off, close & lock the door for 30s.

Start the engine as usual. If there is no sound, change „Radio Market destination” to Germany as well.
Repeat steps 4 & 5.
