Radio Region Conversion Panasonic / Delphi (work in progress)
===============================
Vlinker MC+ or Vlinker MS or OBD Link MX+ is required to make it work.

Before converting the radio frequencies to EU:

1. Delete all saved radio stations
2. Disable HD mode (main screen) - IMPORTANT.
3. Clear all personal data, remove all user settings.
4. Double check if HD is disabled for all users and memory seat positions if car has memory seats and keys.
5. Clear all user settings.

In JScan

1. Go to Radio User settings and change all units to active execpt US/Metric - this is for old radios.
2. Leave „US/Metric under radio setting on/off” as deactived.
3. Change "Radio Market" to Germany or Russia. There are also other options that will work, but these are the most common.
4. Reset the radio with „!Restart all ecus” > „All modules - power on restart” at least two times, and make sure you have OBD adapter that allows communication with radio module.
5. Turn the vehicle off, close & lock the door for 30s.

If this is still not working or the radio is reverting back to previous settings 

6. Play with Radio Destination (Destination) and Radio Market

Eeach year/model has difrent requirement's so it's tricky to make it work.

Start the engine as usual. If there is no sound, change „Radio Market destination” to Germany as well.
Repeat steps 4 & 5.
