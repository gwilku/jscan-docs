Advanced Scan
=============

Requires a license. Allows a more detailed look into any errors reported by the vehicle.

Returns errors and allows clearing them (tap the trash can icon).

.. note:: Advanced Scan and code clearing does NOT solve the reason why errors occur.

There are different error statuses - the status is written jut below the error code

- **stored:** the error occurred in the past and usually is not present anymore. In most cases, this type of error will be permanently deleted when you clear error codes
- **active:** the error is currently reported by the car. In most cases, this error will come back after clearing error codes
- **permanent:** Permanent codes are additional codes. Stored in special memory on PCM ECU, usually they are not showing on most diagnostic tools as they are only used by services in special case. That's why only some tools like JScan will put additional effort to display this additional info.
- **pending** the vehicle diagnostic systems encountered a possible problem, which may turn into active or permanent in the future, if following diagnostic cycles run into it again. Think of it as a warning about future issues.


.. note:: FYI: We are not able provide advice on fixing either mechanical or electrical issues with your car, so a question "how do I fix code XYZ?" should rather go to your car mechanic.
