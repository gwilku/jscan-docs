.. warning:: There is a limitation on iOS to one purchase per item. Please plan ahead. If you bought an item (i.e. 1VIN license) once, and need it again, contact us via Facebook messages.

If you run into problems when purchasing the license, first of all **read** the error message. It usually provides an explanation of what the problem is:

	- "No network connection" issue:
		- make sure you are connected to the web, and **disconnect** from a Wi-Fi cast by the adapter
		- make sure that you have granted JScan all the required permissions: that includes Location / GPS, and make sure GPS is actually enabled. **We do not use or collect this data.** However a connectivity framework on mobile phones is built in a way that requires these permissions.

	- Item already owned error:
		- this can happen if you bought your first licence before 2020, when we introduced account tokens and decoupled the licenses from your Apple/Google ID, and you are trying to buy another license.
		- go to JScan settings > Manage Licenses & Account > Status
		- write down your account token if present
		- tap the green icon (...) and select > "Consume all in-app purchases"
		- close JScan (completely, not just drop to background with the Home button)
		- open JScan again and try buying the license
		- if it still doesn't work, restart the phone
