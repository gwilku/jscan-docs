Adaptive Cruise Control Calibration

.. note:: Applies to Pacifica, WK2 2014+, Durango 2014+, Challenger 2014+, Charger 2011+ (and possibly some more models)


First and foremost, you need to properly align the radar horizontally and vertically. The best solution is a dedicated tool for that.

Once the radar is levelled:

1. Put the key in RUN and connect with JScan as usual.
2. Go to *Adaptations*, tap the search icon and type "ACC".
3. Select "ACC - Sensor Calibration - BETA".
4. Follow the instructions and confirm the levelling of the radar.

.. note:: The app will hint which srew should be adjusted and how much, to set the radar perfectly. The calibration will only succeed if the deviations i below 2%.

5. After confirming the manual levelling, turn the ignition OFF, and then start the engine (don't disconnect JScan).
6. Start the calibration / learning by pressing "GO".
7. A progress indicator will appear. All items need an *OK* status, otherwise the calibration will not begin.
8. Go on a straight road with typical traffic where you can reach a speed of at least 40 km/h.
9. The whole calibration cycle may take between 5 and 15 minutes.
10. Once complete, the progress will show 100%.
11. Stop the vehicle in a safe place and tap "GO".
12. The app will hint to turn the engine off - do it.

The radar is now calibrated, and you can use the Adaptive Cruise Control (refer to your user manual). Of course test teh proper operation of the ACC: activate it, set a distance to preceeding vehicle, and verify that your car actually adjusts the speed to keep the distance.
